# Language-model
A code for a basic language model which responds to the user according to specific key words. 
The language model has three basic functions. 
1) Showcase the weather for the next three days on the location the user inputs.
2) Suggest a restaurant based on the cuisine style and the city the user inputs.
3) Inform the user about the next bus/train on the VÃ¤straffik application in the city of Gothenburg and the stop the user inputs.
The project is part of the course Design of AI systems for my Master's in Statistics and AI
